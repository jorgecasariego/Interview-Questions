/**
 * 
 * Find the point where maximum intervals overlap
 * Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained. 
 * Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. 
 * Note that entries in register are not in any order.

	Example:
	********
	Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}
	       exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
	First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4, 
	second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.
	
	Output: 5
	There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.
