# Basic Operators
Here are some commonly used Java operators you should familiarize yourself with:
& Bitwise AND (). This binary operation evaluates to  (true) if both operands are true, otherwise  (false). In other words:

> 1 & 1 = 1
> 1 & 0 = 0
> 0 & 1 = 0
> 0 & 0 = 0


| Bitwise Inclusive OR (V). This binary operation evaluates to 1 if either operand is true, otherwise 0 (false) if both operands are false. In other words:

> 1 | 1 = 1
> 1 | 0 = 1
> 0 | 1 = 1
> 0 | 0 = 0

^ Bitwise Exclusive OR or XOR (). This binary operation evaluates to 1 (true) if and only if exactly one of the two operands is 1; if both operands are 1 or 0, it evaluates to  0 (false). In other words:

> 1 ^ 1 = 0
> 1 ^ 0 = 1
> 0 ^ 1 = 1
> 0 ^ 0 = 0

~ The unary Bitwise Complement operator flips every bit; for example, the bitwise-inverted -bit binary number 01111001  becomes 1000010, and the bitwise-inverted signed decimal integer 8 becomes -9.
