Essential Algorithm Interview Questions

1. What are Divide and Conquer algorithms?

	Divide and Conquer algorithms are a **paradigm** for solving problems that involve several basics steps. First, we divide the problem into **smaller pieces** and work to **solve each of them independently**. Once we've solved all of the pieces, we take all of the resulting smaller solutions and combine into a single integrated comprehensive solution. 
	
2. Describe how Divide and Conquer work?

	The process can be performed **recursively**; that is, each **"sub problem"** can itself be subdivided into even smaller parts if necessary. This recursive division of the problem is performed until each individual problem is small enough to become relatively trivial to solve. 
	
3. What are some common examples of the types of problems where this aproach might be used?

	Some common examples of problems that lend themselves well to this approach are binary seach, sorting algorithms (e.g., Meger Sort, Quicksort), optimization of computationally complex mathematical operations (Exponentiation, FFT, Strassen's algorithm), and others.
