# FizzBuzz

In this question, you will work with two numbers 3 and 5. The user gives a number as input and then we'll have to get the list of all the numbers starting from 1 till the given number. Now, all we need to do is to find the numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5 and print special words called Fizz and Buzz instead of those multiples respectively. If a number is multiple of both 3 as well as 5 (say 15) FizzBuzz should be printed and if a number is neither a multiple of 3 nor 5 then the number itself is printed.
