 * 
 * What is an island?
 * ******************
 * A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands
 * 
 *			{1, 1,   0,   0, 0},
 *          {0, 1,   0,   0, 1},
 *          	   \ ^ /
 *          {1, 0, < 0 >, 1, 1},
 *          	   / Ë… \
 *          {0, 0,   0,   0, 0},
 *          {1, 0,   1,   0, 1}
 * 
 * 	What we know?
 *  **************
 *  - A cell in 2D matrix can be connected to 8 neighbors.
 *  - In DFS we call recursively all adjacent vertices
 *  - In this example, we have 8 neighbors
 *  	=> So, unlike standard DFS(), where we recursively call for
 *  		adjacent vertices, here we can recursive call for 8 
 *  		neighbors only.
 *  	=> We keep track of the visited 1s so that they are not visited
 *  		again. 
 *  
 *  Time complexity: O(ROW x COL)
 *
