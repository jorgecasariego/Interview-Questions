# Write a program to print all permutations of a given string

A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. 

> A string of length n has n! permutation.

Below are the permutations of string ABC.
ABC ACB BAC BCA CBA CAB

## Time Complexity:

Time complexity of Merge Sort is O(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array in two halves and take linear time to merge two halves.

  > Auxiliary Space: O(n)

  > Algorithmic Paradigm: Divide and Conquer

  > Sorting In Place: No in a typical implementation

  > Stable: Yes
